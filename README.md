## üèÜ About the Hackathon
The **Encode AI Hackathon 2025** is a three-day immersive AI experience hosted in Shoreditch. It brings together top AI talent, developers, and industry leaders for hands-on innovation and collaboration. Our team embraced the opportunity to build **Humming Bird** ‚Äî an intelligent, conversation-driven app that guides aspiring founders from idea to execution using smart AI workflows.


## üöÄ About Humming Bird
**Humming Bird** is an AI-powered startup ideation and tool recommendation assistant that:
- Chats with users to understand their startup vision.
- Breaks down business ideas into structured, actionable development steps.
- Recommends optimal tools and technologies to bring products to life.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How Portia AI Powers Humming Bird
When a user interacts with the Humming Bird app, their business idea is sent to **Portia AI**, which drives the behind-the-scenes workflow. Portia breaks down the process into smart, structured steps to guide users from concept to execution:

1. **Understanding the Idea**: Portia analyzes the user‚Äôs product concept and generates a five-stage development plan, focusing on technical aspects like programming frameworks, UI design, and deployment.
2. **Tool Discovery**: For each stage, Portia intelligently searches for one specific, real-world software tool. It filters out articles or tool lists, returning only concrete tools with:
   - Tool name
   - One-sentence description
   - Official website link
   - Logo image link
3. **Structured Output**: Portia organizes the selected tools into a clean, structured format that's easy for users to follow and act on.

Through this workflow, Portia AI empowers Humming Bird to provide thoughtful, tailored recommendations ‚Äî turning raw ideas into actionable roadmaps.
